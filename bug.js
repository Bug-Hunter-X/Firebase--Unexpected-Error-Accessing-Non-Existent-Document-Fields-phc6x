The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document field that doesn't exist and haven't set a default value.  For example, if you have a document with a structure like this: `{"name": "John Doe"}` and you try to access the field `age` directly without checking for its existence first, you'll get an error. This typically happens when dealing with data fetched from Firestore.  This is often overlooked in simple data retrieval scenarios.
